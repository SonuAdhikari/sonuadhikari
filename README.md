### Hi there.

I am Sonu Adhikari. I am currently studying Data Science and Artificial Intelligence at Asian Institute of Technology, Thailand.

I have completed my Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering from Tribhuvan University,Nepal.

I've worked as a Software Engineer in Cotiviti Nepal(Healthcare Analytics Company). Professionally, I got to work with tons of data (which I love). I got to write SQL scripts, optimise the queries, build several ETL Jobs(Talend,SSIS) and much more. 

You can view my personal projects in the repositories.
