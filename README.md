### Hi there.

I am Sonu Adhikari. I have completed my Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering from Tribhuvan University,Nepal.

Iâ€™m currently working as a Software Engineer in Cotiviti Nepal(Healthcare Analytics Company). Professionally, I get to work with tons of data (which I love). I get to write SQL scripts, optimise the queries, build several ETL Jobs(Talend,SSIS) and much more. 

Along with my professional duties, I have been learning and brushing up my skills in my field of interest - Data Science and Machine Learning. You can view my personal projects in the repositories.
